##Motivation
I learned to play blackjack while I was a caregiver. One of his favorite things to do was go to the casino to play blackjack, but as he was quadriplegic he always needed someone to take him and play with/for him. He ended up teaching me how to play the game and the strategies on when to hit/stay/double/etc. I fell in love with the game too, so we often spent our time going to nearby casinos or on casino cruises. As I have been learning to code, I wanted to build my own blackjack game, so that others too could find the joy in playing.
